MissingOutputException in rule run_simulation in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 4:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:

data/demographic-simulations/snp-matrix_3.txt
data/demographic-simulations/snp-matrix_4.txt
data/demographic-simulations/snp-matrix_5.txt

Removing output files of failed job run_simulation since they might be corrupted:
