MissingOutputException in rule 5 in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 53:
Job 4  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/fastqc/individual_genome_2_R1.fastq (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/fastqc/individual_genome_2_R2.fastq (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
