MissingOutputException in rule 27 in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 365:
Job 26  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genomes_2/gatk/combined_genomes_run_2.g.vcf (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
