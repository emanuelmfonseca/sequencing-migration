MissingOutputException in rule 8 in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 49:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genomes_2/fastqc/individual_genome_2 (missing locally, parent dir contents: individual_genome_2_R1.fastq, .DS_Store, individual_genome_2_R2.fastq)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
