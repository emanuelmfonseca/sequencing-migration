RuleException in rule 5 in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 98:
NameError: The name 'samples_id' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

            touch {output}  # Ensure the output file exists

            n=params.nsamples; samples_id=$(for i in $(seq 1 $n); do echo -n ">s$i >s$i "; done)

            paste {samples_id} {input.individual} >> {output}  # Concatenate individual genomes
