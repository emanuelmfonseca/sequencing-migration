MissingOutputException in rule generate_reads in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 45:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/fastqc/individual_genome_1.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/fastqc/individual_genome_2.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
data/genome-simulations/genomes_2/fastqc/individual_genome_1.fastq.gz (missing locally, parent dir contents: )

Shutting down, this might take some time.
