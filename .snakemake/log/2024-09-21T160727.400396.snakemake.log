MissingOutputException in rule genome_simulation in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 16:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genome-output.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: individual_4_genome-output.txt, individual_1_genome-output.txt, individual_5_genome-output.txt, individual_6_genome-output.txt, individual_18_genome-output.txt, individual_3_genome-output.txt, individual_7_genome-output.txt, individual_19_genome-output.txt, individual_2_genome-output.txt, individual_15_genome-output.txt, individual_10_genome-output.txt, individual_20_genome-output.txt, individual_14_genome-output.txt, reference_genome-output.txt, individual_11_genome-output.txt, individual_17_genome-output.txt, individual_9_genome-output.txt, individual_12_genome-output.txt, individual_16_genome-output.txt, individual_8_genome-output.txt, individual_13_genome-output.txt)
