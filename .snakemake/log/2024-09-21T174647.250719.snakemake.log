MissingOutputException in rule all in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 3:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/reference_genome_1.fasta (missing locally, parent dir not present)
data/genome-simulations/genomes_2/reference_genome_2.fasta (missing locally, parent dir not present)
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/individual_genome_1.fasta (missing locally, parent dir not present)
data/genome-simulations/genomes_1/individual_genome_2.fasta (missing locally, parent dir not present)
data/genome-simulations/genomes_2/individual_genome_1.fasta (missing locally, parent dir not present)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
