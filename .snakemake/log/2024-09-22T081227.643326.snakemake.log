MissingOutputException in rule 12 in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 175:
Job 9  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
