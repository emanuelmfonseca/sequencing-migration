MissingOutputException in rule run_simulation in file /Users/emanuelmfonseca/project/sequencing-migration/Snakefile, line 3:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
snp-matrix.txt
Removing output files of failed job run_simulation since they might be corrupted:
data/demographic-simulations
[Errno 66] Directory not empty: 'data/demographic-simulations'
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
